This is an example blog post written in MDX format. You can replace this with your own content!

## What is MDX?

MDX allows you to use JSX in your markdown content. This means you can import and use React components directly in your blog posts.

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post:

1. Create a new `.mdx` file in `src/features/blog/content/`
2. Add frontmatter with `title`, `publishedAt`, and `summary`
3. Write your content using Markdown syntax
4. Build and deploy!

## Example Code Block

```typescript
const greeting = (name: string) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`);
};

greeting("World");
```

## What's Next?

Start customizing your portfolio by:

- Updating your personal information in the data files
- Adding your projects and experience
- Writing more blog posts
- Customizing the design to match your style

Happy coding! 🚀
